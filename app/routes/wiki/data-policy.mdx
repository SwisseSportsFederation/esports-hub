# Data Policy
The data collected is not used for any other purpose than the Swiss Esports Database and other SESF projects, such as the Swiss Esports Map. The data is not shared with any third party other than agglomerated data used in the Swiss Esports Map.

We work with the services Auth0 (Login) and Vercel (Hosting & Deployment), which each could collect their own data, which is handled by their own data policy. For more information we recommend you read their data policy.

If you have any questions, feel free to write a mail to esportsdb@sesf.ch or ask in the SESF Discord channel.
